&lt;h3&gt;About Foobar Kadigan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was born in Waikikamukau, New Zealand. He left New Zealand for England, excelled
at the University of Mopery, and served in the Royal Loamshire Regiment. While in
service, he invented the kanuten valve used in the processing of unobtainium for
industrial use. With a partner, Granda Fairbook, he founded Acme Manufacturing, later
acquired by the Advent Corporation, to develop his discovery for use in the
Turboencabulator. Mr. Kadigan is now retired and lives in Middlehampton with a favorite
cat, where he raises Griadium frieda and collects metasyntactic variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His favorite quotation has always been:&lt;/p&gt;
